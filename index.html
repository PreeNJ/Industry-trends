The blog includes sample articles on current topics like AI transformation, green computing, data-driven decision making, cybersecurity, future of work, and agile project management. Each article card includes metadata (category, date), engaging visuals, and excerpt previews.

You can expand this by adding more articles, implementing a backend for dynamic content management, or integrating with content management systems. Would you like me to modify any specific aspects or add additional features?




Could you kindly separate the code according to the files

Edit
I'll separate the blog code into individual files for better organization and maintainability.


index.html
Code 

styles.css
Code 

script.js
Code 
Perfect! I've separated the blog code into three organized files:

File Structure:
1. index.html
Contains the complete HTML structure
Semantic markup with proper sections
Links to external CSS and JS files
All content including navigation, hero section, categories, articles, and footer
2. styles.css
All CSS styling separated by sections:
Global styles and resets
Header and navigation styles
Hero section styling
Main content and categories
Article cards and layouts
Footer styles
Animations and keyframes
Responsive design media queries
3. script.js
All JavaScript functionality:
Search functionality
Category filtering
Article interactions
Event listeners
Utility functions
Analytics tracking (placeholder)
DOM manipulation
Key Benefits of This Structure:
✅ Maintainability: Each file has a specific purpose ✅ Scalability: Easy to add new features to specific files ✅ Performance: CSS and JS can be cached separately ✅ Organization: Clean separation of concerns ✅ Team Development: Multiple developers can work on different files ✅ Debugging: Easier to locate and fix issues

To Use These Files:
Create a folder for your blog project
Save each file with its respective name (index.html, styles.css, script.js)
Make sure all three files are in the same directory
Open index.html in a web browser
The blog will function exactly the same as the single-file version, but now with proper file organization for professional development!
